I utilized the Columbia Bootcamp office hours and tutoring

Start by opening the local terminal and running node server.js to get the host to listen on port 3001. Then go to a browser and type in localhost:3001 to start the note taking program. You can then press the GET STARTED button to start a new note. When finished, press the SAVE icon on the top right. You can keep adding new notes and saving them. You can view them by pressing the the title on the left side. You can also delete any note individually by pressing the delete icon next to the saved notes.
